# Toy Robot Coding Challenge

This challenge is designed as a baseline entry point to have a chat with us about a potential career at Ai-Media. It's a small technical requirement that allows us to evaluate key points of interest like, "can they code?" and "can they follow instructions?". From this test, we can prepare some questions for a follow-up interview (see suggestions below or make up your own) to get a better feel for the candidate.
